# Earthquake Exposure Analysis

**Authors:** Surya Jamuna Rani Subramanian & Govindharajulu Ramachandran  
**Course:** Scientific Programming for Geospatial Sciences (Assignment 1)

## Structure
- `src/`: Python source code
- `data/`: Where datasets go
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for testing

## Installation

This project uses Poetry for dependency management.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/js-surya/earthquake_exposure.git
   cd earthquake_exposure
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## How to Run

### 1. Interactive Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)

The main analysis and visualizations are in the notebook.

```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb
```
Open the link in your browser and run all cells to see the interactive dashboard and map.

### 2. REST API (Optional)
We also created a simple REST API to query the earthquake data. You can start it with:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.earthquake_exposure.api:app --reload
```

Then visit these URLs:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - Just shows a welcome message
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/latest_quakes?min_mag=6.0` - Gets earthquakes from the last week

The `min_mag` parameter filters by magnitude (default is 5.0).

**Tip:** FastAPI automatically creates documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` where you can test the endpoints in your browser.

### 3. Run Tests
To verify the logic (data cleaning, projection, metrics):
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```
